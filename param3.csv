it was a hot summer day and there was a thirsty crow.
the crow flew over the houses and the fields but couldn't find water.
he flew over one house.
he saw water in a pot.
he couldn't reach the water.
so, he threw rocks into the water.
he threw rocks to increase water level.
after some time, he could drink from it.
moral is that you should work hard.
